# About Me

I am an urban planner, civic technologist, open data junkie, map geek, and small d democracy nerd. I currently work as Director of Data Governance in the Office of Data and Analytics in the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation. Previous projects include Civic Roam, Fearless Cities NYC Summit 2018, IDNYC, CivicDashboards, City Atlas, ioby.org, and VoteScope. I have a Masters degree in Urban Planning with a concentration in GIS and civic technology from Hunter College.
