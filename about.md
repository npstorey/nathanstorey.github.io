# About Me

I am an urban planner, civic technologist, open data junkie, map geek, and small d democracy nerd. As a Senior Project Manager for the NYC Mayor's Office of Operations, I work on HOME-STAT, New York City's street homelessness initiative.
Previous projects include Civic Roam, Fearless Cities NYC Summit 2018, IDNYC, CivicDashboards, City Atlas, ioby.org, and VoteScope. I have a Masters degree in Urban Planning with a concentration in GIS and civic technology from Hunter College.
